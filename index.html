A character sprinted across a digital landscape in one of the latest offerings from Mr. Tran’s company, which localizes international video games for online publication in Vietnam and designs 3-D art for games by Sony, Microsoft and Electronic Arts. You just run, run, run until you hit something,” said Mr. Tran, who founded Glass Egg in 1999 after a short stint at a computer game start-up in San Francisco.
