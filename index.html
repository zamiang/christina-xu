            Recently, I've been:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>teaching the Orbital 1K course along with Gary Chou and a team of all-star advisors; Gary and I also teach <a href="http://entrepreneurdesigners.tumblr.com">Entrepreneurial Design</a> with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/leland">Leland Rechis</a> at <a href="http://interactiondesign.sva.edu">SVA's Interaction Design MFA program</a> during the spring semester.</li>
            <li>running interim operations for <a href="http://ea1.co">Everybody at Once</a>, while they bootstrapped from 3 to 9 full-time staff in their first year. Recently, my work has focused on designing new workflows to maximize collaboration, learning, and efficiency for the team.</li>
            <li>conducting ethnographic research with <a href="http://pldata.io">PL Data</a>, a consultancy that helps organizations integrate quantitative and qualitative research approaches to find useful insights.</li>
            <li>writing weekly posts at <a href="https://medium.com/chrysaora-weekly">Chrysaora Weekly</a> with the help of supereditor Diana Kimball and more sporadic posts about culture and tech in the Greater China region for <a href-"http://88-bar.com/">88 Bar</a>.</li>
            <li>advising for <a href="http://orbitalnyc.com/">Orbital</a>, a supportive space for independent creators, and for <a href="http://datasociety.net">the Data & Society Research Institute</a>.</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="large">
            In my previous lives, I ran <a href="http://www.breadpig.com">Breadpig</a>, a sidekick service for independent creators, where I advised on and produced $2 million worth of crowdfunding campaigns; served as the global coordinator for <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org">Awesome Foundation</a>, an international group of guerrilla philanthropists; co-founded ROFLCon, an internet culture conference/convention that ran from 2008-2012; wrote a thesis on the history of interfaces and protocols for instant messaging. It's even nerdier than you imagine.
