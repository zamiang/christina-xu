  about-body-one: "Prior to joining the University, May led New York University’s (NYU) initiative to establish full-degree granting campus in Shanghai, the first-ever American university given such permission. May oversaw all aspects of the effort from the seed of an idea to envisioning the design of a new academic program including three research institutes. She led negotiations with NYU’s Chinese counterparts, obtained appropriate governmental approvals in China (at local and central government levels) and managed US stakeholders including the Board of Trustees, deans, faculties across six schools, and the heads of all relevant operational functions. In addition, May assembled the core management team ultimately leading to a bicultural, bilingual co-located team of 120 in New York and Shanghai. In sum, May’s strategic vision, ability to create new infrastructural and business frameworks, and broad operational knowledge resulted in an inaugural entering class in September 2013."
  about-body-two: "From 1990 to 1994, May practiced law at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bond Market Association.  Prior to law school, May began her career in 1984 at Kamsky Associates, one of the first consulting firms to work with multi-national companies in China. She managed two offices and represented over 60 companies to the relevant central, provincial and local authorities; negotiated a number of major sales, licensing, technology transfer, and investment deals for clients across a broad array of sectors."
  about-body-three: "In 2000, May left Goldman Sachs with a colleague to start a technology firm that adapted financial trading technology from for business-to-consumer and business-to-business applications. As Co-Founder and CEO, May oversaw capital-raising, business development, HR, marketing and legal. In 2004 she joined a fledgling marketing/advertising agency where she remained for four years.  Initially, she served as the COO and became the CEO in 2007 after achieving consecutive years of double-digit growth. During those four years, May instituted operational systems, formulated strategy with the two co-founders, won business from high profile clients and grew the business from $800,000 to $20m in revenue."

  bio: "Currently, I work as a freelance organizational designer and researcher as well as teaching in the <a href="http://interactiondesign.sva.edu">Interaction Design program at SVA</a>. I write weekly with the help of my friend Diana Kimball, and more sporadically and independently on 88 Bar and my own blog. I'm also an advisor to Orbital and the Data & Research Institute."
  shortprof: "In previous lives, I have helped creators run over $2 million worth of crowdfunding campaigns while running day-to-day operations at Breadpig, served as the global coordinator for Awesome Foundation, co-founded ROFLCon (an internet culture conference/convention), and written a thesis on the history of instant messengers. I believe deeply in the importance of creating community spaces, building subversive infrastructure, and nurturing intersectional identities. I'm an observer and organizer of communities, both online and off-, and I'm particularly interested in youth subcultures, cultural translation & syncretism, and user reappropriations of technology."
